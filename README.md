# odin-recipes
First html assignment of The Odin Project, a recipe website.

This is a basic recipes webpage containing three recipes centred around the idea of mealprep. All recipes are vegetarian. This assignment will be used to demonstrate html skills that I have learned.

The website will be expanded with css as it is learnt throughout the course.
