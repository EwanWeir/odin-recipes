        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>A delicious, hearty meal, adapted to be vegetarian and full of bean protein. Very filling and great for cold nights. May have many ingredients, but is fairly simple to make.</p>
        <p><strong>Serves: 5</strong></p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 medium red onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 large red bell pepper, chopped</li>
            <li>2 medium carrots, chopped</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, pressed or minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chili powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 large can diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 can black beans, rinsed</li>
            <li>1 can pinto beans</li>
            <li>2 cups vegetable broth</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering. Add the chopped onion, bell pepper, carrot and ¼ teaspoon of the salt. Stir to combine and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender and the onion is translucent, about 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic, chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika and oregano. Cook until fragrant while stirring constantly, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add the diced tomatoes and their juices, the drained black beans and pinto beans, vegetable broth and bay leaf. Stir to combine and let the mixture come to a simmer. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally and reducing heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer, for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the chili from the heat and discard the bay leaf. For the best texture and flavor, transfer 1 ½ cups of the chili to a blender, making sure to get some of the liquid portion. Securely fasten the lid and blend until smooth (watch out for hot steam), then pour the blended mixture back into the pot. (Or, you can blend the chili briefly with an immersion blender, or mash the chili with a potato masher until it reaches a thicker, more chili-like consistency.)</li>
            <li>Divide the mixture into individual bowls and serve with garnishes of your choice.</li>
