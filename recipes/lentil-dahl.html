            <li>3 Garlic cloves, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Ginger, peeled and grated</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Chilli flakes</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Cumin seeds</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Coriander seeds</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Mustard seeds</li>
            <li>2 tsp Tumeric</li>
            <li>1 tsp Garam masala</li>
            <li>200g Dried red lentils</li>
            <li>1 can (400ml) Coconut milk</li>
            <li>1 can (400ml) Chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>500ml Vegetable stock</li>
            <li>2 Handfuls fresh spinach</li>
            <li>Rice, to serve</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a glug of oil in a large pan over a medium heat. Fry the onion gently for 5 minutes. Add the garlic, ginger and red chilli and cook for a few minutes more.</li>
            <li>Whilst that is cooking, grind the cumin, coriander and mustard seeds lightly in a pestle and mortar. Then add to the pan, along with the turmeric and garam masala and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the lentils along with the tomatoes, coconut milk and stock, then stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper and cook on a medium/low heat until thick - at least 15-20 minutes (stirring often so that it doesn't stick to the pan).Taste and add more chilli if desired.</li>
            <li>While that's cooking, prepare your rice according the instructions on the packet.</li>
            <li>Add the handfuls of spinach. Allow the spinach to wilt and then serve with your chosen accompaniment.</li>
        </ol>
